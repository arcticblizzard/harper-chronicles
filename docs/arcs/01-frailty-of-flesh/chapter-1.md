# Chapter 1

The medbay on the _Wayfinder_ was small, targeting function over form. Brushed steel panels patterned the walls, broken up by medical implements: task lighting, armatures, and fluid lines. Above the sole cot where MC stretched out, a dim diagnostic screen pulsed, its rhythm highlighting and shading details in turns. The air was tinged with the smell of antiseptic and recycled oxygen.

MC's Outrider Hat was lovingly stowed at the foot of the cot, its high crown and wide brim flecked with dried blood. _[Even with his arm mangled beyond use, MC made sure to collect his hat before retreating back to the ship. One of these times, his sentimentality will cost dearly.]_ He was still wearing the wreck of his jumpsuit, the missing sleeve now mirroring his missing arm. The medical weave applied by the medbay shortly after the amputation glistened at the edges of his wound, knitting tissue as his body fought the fear, pain, and shock of the incident. I could already feel the ghost of the missing limb in his nervous system: an itch he could not scratch, a weight that was no longer there. _[Human bodies haunt themselves. They lose pieces, yet insist those pieces still exist, it is both macabre and fascinating.]_

MC grimaced and rubbed at his temple with his remaining arm. "Harper, I know it hurts. You don't have to keep reminding me."

His frustration registered before his words, sparking across his synapses like static. The emotions beneath it I have yet to be able to parse: dread?

"Its not dread Harper. What I am feeling, at least besides the pain and frustration and a bit of euphoria from the drugs, is loss. That was my favorite limb. It is gone and won't be coming back. The closest I can get is a crude facsimile." His head tilted toward the empty space past his shoulder. He whispered to himself, "There is no replacing the real deal."

MC's shifted in his cot, his eyes clearing and narrowing on the diagnostic screen. "Do you think there will be a Rigger in this Sector with the chops to craft me a new one?"

I supplied the answer without hesitation. "We're in the Outlands, the preliminary probably stands at 54%. Our copy of the Weave is a few cycles old now, not that many Outlanders bother with sector record upkeep. Any information we do find will be sorely outdated. We could boost that probability by relocating to X. A broker there would have a more certain and up to date catalog."

MC exhaled through his teeth, the sharp sound edged with resignation. The emotion rippled through me as a tangle of determination and grief, threads inseparable even under my analysis. _[Even in despair, he carries momentum. This may be the only reason humanity has survived this long in the void.]_

MC raised his left hand, placing it upon the bleak-iron neural interface at his temple. He started his ritual vow in the traditional way: "By Iron". It was quickly followed by "I will not live half-made. I will find a Rigger and be made whole again." 

_[I'll never understand these vows, especially the ritual behind them. Is performing the task not enough? What do these extraneous words add to the effort?]_
