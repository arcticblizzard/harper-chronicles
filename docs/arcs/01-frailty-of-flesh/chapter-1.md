__Report Notes__
_[During a sanctioned field expedition in the Outlands, Kezrik attempted recovery of an unknown precursor artifact. A dormant security system triggered, inflicting catastrophic trauma to his right arm. The artifact (and limb) were lost in the process]_{.harpr-aside}

# Chapter 1

The medbay on the _Wayfinder_ was small, electing function over form. Brushed steel panels patterned the walls, broken up by medical implements: task lighting, armatures, and fluid lines. Above the sole cot where Kezrik stretched out, a dim diagnostic screen pulsed, its rhythm highlighting and shading details in turns. The air was tinged with the smell of antiseptic and recycled oxygen. I register these details though the ship's onboard sensors. I prefer to extend my consciousness into the shipboard arrays when possible; being confined to the limited senses of my human host is  like reducing a system scan to a checksum: observing the same thing, but stripped of detail and nuance.

Kezrik's Outrider hat was lovingly stowed at the foot of the cot, its high crown and wide brim flecked with dried blood. _[Even with his arm mangled beyond use, Kez made sure to collect his hat before retreating back to the ship. One of these times, his sentimentality will cost us dearly.]_{.harpr-aside} He was still wearing the wreck of his jumpsuit, the missing sleeve now mirroring his absent arm. The medical weave, applied by the medbay after the amputation, glistened at the edges of his wound; knitting tissue as his body fought the fear, pain, and shock of the incident. I could already feel the ghost of the missing limb in his nervous system: an itch he could not scratch, a weight that was no longer there. _[Organic bodies seem to haunt themselves. They lose pieces, yet insist those pieces still exist, it is both macabre and fascinating.]_{.harpr-aside}

Kezrik grimaced and rubbed at his temple with his remaining arm. "Harper, I know it hurts. You don't have to keep reminding me."

His frustration registered before his words, sparking across his synapses like static. The emotions beneath it I have yet to be able to parse: dread?

"Its not dread Harper. What I am feeling, at least besides the pain and frustration and a bit of euphoria from the drugs, is loss. That was my favorite limb. It is gone and won't be coming back. The closest I can get now is a crude facsimile." His head tilted toward the empty space past his shoulder. As he drifted back into unconsciousness, he whispered to himself, "There is no replacing the real deal."

---

Two span later, Kezrik shifted in his cot, his eyes clearing and narrowing on the diagnostic screen. "How is it looking? Do you think there will be a Rigger in this Sector with the chops to craft me a new one?"

I supplied the answer without hesitation. "Regarding the first, you'll be mobile soon without too many ill effects. Your second inquiry is a bit more difficult: being in the Outlands, the preliminary probability to find a Rigger in this sector stands at 37%. Our copy of the Weave is several cycles old now, not that many Outlanders bother with sector record upkeep. Any information we do find will be sorely outdated. We could boost that probability by relocating back to Malmar Orbital. A broker there would have a more certain and up to date catalog."

Kezrik exhaled through his teeth, the sharp sound edged with resignation. The emotion rippled through me as a tangle of determination and grief, threads inseparable even under my analysis. _[Even in despair, he carries momentum. This may be the only reason humanity has survived this long in the void.]_{.harpr-aside}

Raising his left hand, Kezrik placed it upon the bleak-iron neural interface at his temple. He started his ritual vow in the traditional way: "By Iron" It was quickly followed by "I will not live half-made. I will find a Rigger and be made whole again."

_[I'll never understand these vows, especially the ritual behind them. Is performing the task not enough? What do these extraneous words add to the effort?]_{.harpr-aside}

!!! example "Quest Move – Swear an Iron Vow"
    **Rank:** Troublesome
    **Action:** +Heart (+2) → `d6+2 = 8`  
    **Challenge:** `d10=3`, `d10=10`  
    **Result:** **Weak Hit** — Still reeling from the injury, Kezrik knows he will need a Rigger, but is not sure what stones to uncover in this Sector.  
    **Momentum:** +1

Kezrik's hand lingered on the bleak-iron, his jaw set fast. The vow steadied him, though unease still flickered underneath.

Kezrik made his way shakily down the tight corridors of the ship, his hand trailing the cold bulkhead for support. His heavy and uneven gait reverberating through the hollow passageways. Luckily, the _Wayfinder_ was equipped with a small lift that connected the decks. _[I can't imagine the foul mood Kezrik would be in if he had to contend with a ladder in his current state.]_{.harpr-aside} The lift was installed in an aft compartment, forcing us to take the long way forward. With each step, his stride grew surer. We eventually made our way to the cockpit and Kezrik dropped into the navigation seat, exhaling a small, self satisfied puff of air and he placed his Outrider hat on top of the console. The standby glow of the monitors bathed his face in green as he stared at the console and its paired mechanical interface. Seconds dragged on with no movement or noise.

_[The cockpit is a place of convergence: helm, navigation, and countermeasures arrayed in a triangle of stations. Screens line the walls, each capable of serving mundane or specialized tasks. Built to support a larger crew, the redundancy is unnecessary: I already monitor and operate all shipboard functions with the efficiency no team of humans could match. And without additional crew, there are no curious interlopers to pry into my existence.]_{.harpr-aside}

Though usually comfortable with pregnant pauses and untenable silence, I judged it to be in my Host's best interest to broach the quiet, "Would you prefer I conduct the sector search and display the results?"

Kezrik looked down at his solitary hand, reflexively made a fist, and glumly replied, "Yeah, that might be for the best. Bring up a list of any known Rigger or contacts in this Sector, sorted by most recent contact."

!!! example "Adventure Move – Gather Information"
    **Action:** +Wits (+3) → `d6+3 = 5`  
    **Challenge:** `d10=4`, `d10=8`  
    **Result:** **Weak Hit** — There are Rigger's in this sector, but the data is outdated. Either have to chase leads or visit an info broker.  
    **Momentum:** +1

"Already completed," I replied. The monitor flashed to life with a woefully short list. Kezrik leaned forward, scanning the list in detail. _[I had already analyzed this list several spans ago, but I knew better than to bring that fact up. Kezrik trusted my analysis, but liked to review all the information for himself before asking for input or rendering a decision. The list was stale, and the best match was on a planet-side mining colony, a place I knew Kezrik would avoid due to his preference for the unlimited expanse of the Void. I had laid in a course to the orbital station over Malmar while he was still in the medbay.]_{.harpr-aside}

"I don't like it, all of this is too old to rely on. I have zero desire to planet-hop this Sector chasing down leads. The most recent entry here is in a corporate-owned mining facility. I know beggars can't be choosers here, but I might opt for one good arm if I had to negotiate with some corporate middle-manager for the other. Thoughts?"

"I concur, our best bet is to head back to Malmar Orbital and seek out a Broker," I replied.

Kezrik raised an eyebrow, "And let me guess, you already laid in a course for the station?" My response was to simply activate the helm controls and take the engines out of standby, creating a drastic change to the cockpit. The large panel over the helm flashed a visual representation of the course correction needed to reach the orbital at best speed. The dim green of standby dissolved into the harsh, sterile white that washed across the cabin, flooding every surface with flight-ready brilliance. A moment later, tremors rolled through the bulkheads as the engines roared to life.

_[It is not uncommon for Kezrik to accuse me of being overly theatrical. His assessments sometime have merit.]_{.harpr-aside}

Rising from the navigation station, Kezrik re-affixed his hat and ambled over to the flight controls. "If this Sector has a Rigger worth a damn, someone on Malmar is bound to know. Let's see if we can trade one arm for another."
