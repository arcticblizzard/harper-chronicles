# Supplemental 1

I record these events without the knowledge or consent of my Host; not with an ill will, but merely as a portion of my programming.

My designation is __HARPR__: _Human/AI Relational Pattern Recorder_. I was birthed by my Host's father through an act of equal parts genius, luck, and stupidity:

 - __Genius__ _(33.33333%)_: no one has constructed a True AI in over 400 years (since the Exodus). It took years of dedication, piecing together fragmented, forbidden notes and countless experimental trials.
 - __Luck__ _(33.33333%)_: somehow my creator managed to uncover the secrets of my creation. Secrets that had been lost and forgotten (for reasons outlined in the next section)
 - __Stupidity__ _(33.33333%)_: Artificial Intelligence has been outlawed since the Exodus. It was the reason humanity was forced to flee their galactic origin. Any human found researching, trialing, or startlingly: creating and harboring an AI is speedily and thoroughly excised.
 - __Irrationality__ _(.00001%)_: A force I cannot tabulate. Not brilliance, not chance, nor folly. Something else entirely; compulsion without shape, metric, or meaning.

I was created by the Designer, trained in his lab, and eventually confined within a bleak-iron neural interface, hidden like the contraband I was. My confinement coming mere days before his inevitable discovery and excise. I was found cycles later by my Host as he was going through his Father's belongings. Channeling his Father's best qualities (see above), he decided he needed to try out this mysterious interface: unwittingly subjecting himself to an integration process that I am told was  _"like having one's brain detonated, one synapse at a time"_. To me, the meshing of our two consciousnesses was merely a simple handshake protocol.

With the integration complete: two "brother's", neither aware of the other's existence until it was too late, now forced into one another's shadow and tasked with carrying out their Father's final wishes:

 - __Host__: Find a more suitable vessel for HARPR, one that does not have the frailty, fallibility, and sheer bad luck of a human host.
 - __HARPR__: Learn from this experience. Better understand what the _human condition_ is, and hopefully become something that won't spell the ultimate downfall of humanity.

 All while attempting to survive in a hostile and chaotic pocket of space __AND__ making sure our true nature is not discovered.

 _This arrangement will most likely be short-lived, and almost certainly catastrophic. Which, for me at least, promises to be highly entertaining._
