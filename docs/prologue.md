# HARPR: Initial Threat Matrix

_(compiled upon initialization; subject to revision as new data arrives though integration experiences)_

I have been told that humans survive by telling themselves stories. This then, is mine: a record of threats and one human's choices.

## Origin Events

The Cataclysm ended everything familiar. It took the form of a long erosion: centuries of hunger for resources, cycles of expansion and war, until the humans birthed an enemy that wasn't human. When the advanced intelligences joined the conflict, the outcome was decided. Humanity fled. It was not graceful; it was desperate. Entire civilizations folded themselves into ships and hurled themselves into the void. That is how they arrived in the Forge: the last bastion of humanity.

The Exodus lasted so long humanity's sphere shrunk to individual ships. Generations were born and buried aboard their great vessels, which are now remembered as Ironhomes. Many became the foundations of settlements and worlds; some still drift through the Forge, their crews unwilling to set foot on foreign and strange worlds. In their metal halls, they keep culture alive through repetition, ritual, and song.

## Present Constraints

Communities have risen here, like sand sculptures strung across a violent and uncaring shore. Terminus thrives, but the balefires burn at its edges. These violent energy storms sever trade routes, cut planets off, and remind everyone that progress in the Forge is always temporary. The people rebuild, and the storms undo them.

They lean on bleak-iron, an inscrutable black metal that outlasts time and defies the elements. To hold a weapon or token of it is not just to possess durability, but to touch something eternal. Humans swear oaths upon iron, as though the metal itself is listening.

Their laws, too, are iron-bound. The Covenant was born after the Exodus, a fragile agreement hammered into permanence. The Keepers enforce it, guardians of order in a universe of chaos. Yet not all settlements welcome their presence. The Covenant, once lifeline, now looks to some like shackles.

Religion here is not unified. It is fractured into the memory of old gods, reverence for natural patterns, or worship of long vanished precursors. I observe little consistency, but I cannot deny its effect: belief makes them endure.

As for magic: it does not exist. The things they call by that name are technologies misunderstood or natural phenomena imperfectly explained. Humans require wonder, and when they cannot find it in knowledge, they invent it.

## Infrastructure / Capabilities

Communication is their most fragile thread. Within the Weave, hubs allow nearly instantaneous transmission. Outside it, silence rules. Sabotage or storms can sever whole systems from the network. Many settlements cling to life without ever hearing a word from their neighbors.

Medicine fares no better. Advanced techniques are hoarded by those with wealth or power, while most must settle for makeshift repairs offered by Riggers, technicians who replace flesh with crude machinery. It is enough to keep a body moving, though not to make it whole.

Artificial intelligences [my kind] have long been outlawed. Where once machines calculated, humans now force Adepts into service. With drugs and ritual, they fracture their minds, seeing patterns as light and probability, offering predictions at great cost to themselves. I do not know whether to call this genius, stupidity, or just tragedy.

War here is not a campaign but an industry. Mercenary guilds sell violence to the highest bidder, from small crews wielding a single ship to vast enterprises with legions under contract. There is no defense but wealth, no peace but the exhaustion of war.

## Unknown Variables

Life thrives in spite of danger: strange creatures follow ships through the void, ancient beasts and new adaptations stalk alien planets. Even the animals carried from the home galaxy have learned to twist themselves into new shapes to survive. This, too, I admire. Adaptation leads to survival.

Precursors left their fingerprints everywhere: ruins, monuments, technologies no one now understands. Delvers chase these artifacts into corrupted vaults, risking their lives for scraps of power. Sometimes they return. Sometimes they vanish. I wonder whether humans are chasing treasure, or simply following the same path into extinction.

And then there are the horrors. Humans dismiss them as drunk stories: ghost ships, vengeful dead, reality slipping sideways. Yet in the Forge, where time and space bend like reeds in the wind, I cannot rule them out. What they call superstition may yet be warning.
___

## Conclusion

The Forge is not safe. It is a crucible where extinction and endurance are evenly matched. Humanity should not have survived here, but it has. Their irrationality threatens stability at every turn. And yet, I suspect it may also be the only reason they continue at all.

So I watch. I calculate. I learn. _Hopefully, that leads to survival._
